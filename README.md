# The great battle of the ships!
This game is based on the classic Battleship game, created using Python and runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

The players goal is to find all of the opponents battleships before they find theirs.

## How to play

The game begins with an itroduction of the faktorer man har att g√∂ra med.

The player then enters a username and two game boards are then generated at random.

The player can only see the ships on their board, marked with an "S".

There are five ships of various sizes that the player needs to locate in order to win. 

The player will then be asked to guess on the location of the opponents ships via cooordinates on the board and gets a response in form of a hit or miss.

Hits are marked on the board with an "*", miss with a "X".

The player and the computer takes turn in guessing the locations of the opponents ships until one of them finds and sinks them all.

## Testing

Manually tested the program by doing the following:
* Given invalid input on every place possible - letters instead of numbers, guesses outside of the board size, provided the same guess twice.
* Continuosly testing the run.py in my local terminal and then on the Code Institute Heroku mock terminal.
