The player can only see the ships on their board, marked with an "S".

There are five ships of various sizes that the player needs to locate in order to win. 

The player will then be asked to guess on the location of the opponents ships via cooordinates on the board and gets a response in form of a hit or miss.

Hits are marked on the board with an "*", miss with a "X".

The player and the computer takes turn in guessing the locations of the opponents ships until one of them finds and sinks them all.
